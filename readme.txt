Zoomd Search is a monetizable site search – intuitive, beautiful and visually rich

== Description ==
Zoomd Search gives your visitors a beautiful search experience, to help them find what they are looking for, easily and efficiently. It engages your visitors, improves conversion and adds monetization to your site.

With a look that stands out, your site search will no longer be ignored, and you’ll be able to offer your visitors a great exploration experience, by presenting them with rich search results that highlight your content.
